MANUAL

CDCOVER is a little commandline tool which creates
user-defined data-cd covers. After installing
the program, open a shell and enter "cdcover". The
program gives you a overview of the supported
parameters. Should be easy to use.


PARAMETERS 

I will explain the parameters with the following
example:

I want to create covers for my SuSE
Linux Distribution, which consists of 6 CDs.



-c, --count <NUMBER OF CDs>
Sets the number of cds. The default is "1".

Example: -c 6



-t, --title <TITLE>
Sets the title which appears on the top of the 
frontcover and on the left of each sidetext

Example: -t "SuSE Linux 6.3"



-s, --subtitle <SUBTITLE>
Sets the subtitle which appears below the title on the 
frontcover and on the right of each sidetext. Remember
that you can use the variables %i (number of the current
cd-rom) and %n (total number of cd-roms) in every string
constant (title, subtitle etc...). They will automatically
be replaced by the program. Now back to the example. I
wanted to create 6 cover for my Linux Distribution CDs.
I think it would be good to use the subtitle for the
enumberation ( Disc 1/6,  Disc 2/6, ... Disc 6/6 ).

Example: -s "Disc %i/%n"



-b, --backcovertext <BACKCOVERTEXT>
Sets the text, which should appear on the back of the
cover. This text can contain linebreaks.

Example 1 : -b "SuSE Linux Distribution Version 6.3"
Example 2 : -b "`ls -1 /cdrom/*.tgz`
Example 3 : -b "`cat`" 



-o, --outputfile <FILENAME>
Finally you have got to specify the file were the
latex output will be stored. The file should have
the extension ".tex". If you don't specify an output
file, the output will be written on the standard 
output.

Example: -o suse.tex



-l, --sidetext-left <SIDETEXT-LEFT>
This is an optional parameter. Usually the title
will be printed on the left side of each sidetext.
If you want an other text than the title use this
parameter.


-r, --sidetext-right <SIDETEXT-RIGHT>
This is also an optional parameter. Usually the subtitle
will be printed on the right side of each sidetext.
If you want an other text than the subtitle use this
parameter.





PRINTING

Now you have the latex file. For example "suse.tex".
To print or view this text you have to convert the
file to PostScript. Enter the following commands:

latex suse.tex

If everything works correct you should find the file
suse.dvi in the current directory. You have to
convert this dvi-file to PostScript by entering:

dvips suse.dvi -o suse.ps

Now you finally have the postscript-file "suse.ps".
You can now view this file with any postscript viewer.

For example:

gv suse.ps
ghostview suse.ps
kghostview suse.ps

You can print the file with the lpr command:

lpr suse.ps

Alternatively, on modern linuxes...

pdflatex suse.tex
gnome-open suse.pdf
