CDCOVER INSTALLATION
----------------

GNU\LINUX and UNIX-Systems:
    
    Extract the sourcefiles from the tar-archive.
    If you have an other c++ compiler than the g++-compiler,
    you need to change the entry "COMPILER=g++" in the
    Makefile to "COMPILER=<your compiler name>". 
    Then type "make" in the direcroty of the ccc-Makefile 
    to build the executable "ccc".
    Ccopy the executable in a directory of your
    choice that is listet in the $PATH Variable. This
    should usually be "/usr/local/bin" or "/usr/bin".
    You can also type "make install" to install the
    file automatically to "/usr/local/bin".
    

Windows 95,98,2000,NT:

    Unlike all the Unix-Systems, Windows doesn't come 
    with a C-Compiler. If you haven't got a C-Compiler
    then first download and install the free compiler 
    form www.cygnus.com .
    Extract the files from the tar-archive then start
    the shell and change the directory in which  you
    extracted the source-files.
    If you have an other compiler than the g++-compiler,
    you need to change the entry "COMPILER=g++" in the
    Makefile to "COMPILER=<your compiler name>".
