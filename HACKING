HACKING
-------

This file is for every hacker who wants to reuse
some code of the cdcover-program or who wants to
make improvements or bugfixes. Read this text first.



STRINGLIB

The cdcover program makes heavy use of the c++-classes
"Bytevector" and "Stringlist", which are defined
in bytevector.cc and stringlist.cc.  I don't like
the stirng-class of the c++ standard library, so I
have written my own. 
You can use these classes as black boxes. 
They are well tested and should work properly.
Take a look to the header files "bytevector.h" 
and "stringlist.h" to get information about available
functions. Only very few functions are needed in cdcover.


TEXT2H

text2h is a little program which converts textfiles
into c++ header files with "char* argv[]" vector
constants. See text2h.cc for the source code.
This tool is used to create the string-ressource
files, which are used to include the tex-templates
and the cdcover-ressources.

CDCOVER

The cdcover program consists of the following files:

ccc.cc        - main program, parameter, error messages
cccpara.h     - cdcover parameters
cccpara2.h    - cdcover parameters WITHOUT value
                These two files are needed by ccc.cc
				for parameter-parsing

texmaker.h    - cover class interface is defined here
texmaker.cc   - implementation of the cover class                
res*.h        - c++ headers with latex template constants  
                created from the texfiles by the text2h utility


Check especially the "texmaker.*" files, if you want 
to reuse the cover-generator in other applications.

improvements feel free to contact me:
